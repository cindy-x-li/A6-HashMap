Hash Map Implementation: 2 Ways

## Description
For my final project in Oregon State University's CS 225 Data Structure class, I implemented a hash map in two ways: chaining and open addressing.
hash_map_sc.py uses linked lists as buckets for each hashed index. hash_map_oa.py uses quadratic probing to resolve collosions.
